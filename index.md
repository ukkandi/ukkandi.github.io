# Uday Kandi

I’m 18 and focused on building tools that improve human wellbeing, especially at the intersection of healthcare, generative AI, and memory systems. My work centers on experiments, hackathon projects, and early prototypes that test how emerging tech can create real-world impact. Everything I build is aimed at helping people first — the projects matter more than the ego.

## About Me
I’m using my early years to develop skill, velocity, and a public track record of shipped work. I document openly so the results are visible and the progress compounds. My long-term interest is in building technologies that support human health, cognition, and quality of life.
